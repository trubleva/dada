        "<p>Toddlers are learning to navigate their world, communicate, and control some parts of their lives. They don't actually have control over much, but eating is one of the first areas they will master. Parents can help them enjoy their <i>limited</i> power by giving them appropriate amounts of freedom when it comes to choosing foods and eating them. That's not to say toddlers are deciding what to have for dinner. Parents have the important job of providing the kinds of foods that an active toddler needs.</p><p>A parent's role is to present healthy foods and let a child decide which ones to eat - \"or whether to eat at all\". Parents can steer a toddler toward healthy eating, but might have to do it in a crafty way. By <i>anticipating</i> problems and offering choices, parents teach kids which behaviors will yield positive results and which ones won't. Here's how to turn common concerns into opportunities to teach healthy eating habits.</p><h3>Most Toddlers Are Picky Eaters</h3><p>Many toddlers express their budding independence through eating - or not eating, as the case may be. So <b>nearly all toddlers</b> could be described as picky eaters. If kids don't like a food, they won't eat it - no rocket science there.</p><p>Does your toddler want to eat only macaroni and cheese? When a child is stuck on one food, a parent might feel forced to serve that food every day so the child eats something. But eventually the child may tire of that food - and then what?</p><p>You choose the foods on your toddler's plate - and you don't have to serve macaroni and cheese daily. If you do, you miss an opportunity to introduce new foods and increase the number of those your child is willing to eat. Most of these 'food jags' won't last long if parents don't give in to them.</p>",
